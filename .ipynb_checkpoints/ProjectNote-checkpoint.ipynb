    "## Fermat factorization\n",
    "\n",
    "Fermat factorization method is very straight forward, if we are going to factor $n$, since: $$n = ab \\Rightarrow \\left [\\frac{1}{2}(a+b) \\right ]^{2} - \\left [\\frac{1}{2}(a-b) \\right ]^{2}$$let $$ x= \\frac{1}{2}(a+b),\\ y= \\frac{1}{2}(a-b) \\Rightarrow n = x^2 - y^2$$ Therefore, we just need to find a $x$ satisfy: $$Q(x) = y^2 = x^2 - n$$ <br/> and obviously, the smallest $x$ is $\\lceil \\sqrt[2]{n}\\rceil$ and if we can find a $Q(x)$ is a square root, then we can find the factors of $n$ which is $a=x+y, b=x-y$\n",

    "## Kraitchik factorization\n",
    "\n",
    "Kraitchik's method is instead of checking $x^2-n$ is a square, he sugguests to check $x^2 - kn$ a square number, which is equivalent to find $y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod{n} $. And the only interesting soluation is $ x \\not\\equiv \\pm y \\pmod{n}$. Besides this, instead of seeking one $x^2-n$ is square, he was looking for a set of number $ \\{x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_k\\} $ such that $\\displaystyle y^2 \\equiv \\prod_{i=1}^k{(x_i^2 - n)} \\equiv \\prod_{i=1}^k{x_i^2} \\equiv \\left (\\prod_{i=1}^k{x_i}\\right)^2 \\pmod{n} $ is square. For example, if we want to factor 2080, our $x$ begin with $\\lceil\\sqrt{2080}\\rceil=46$\n",

    "> Dixon’s method replaces the condition “is the square of an integer” with the much weaker one “has only small prime factors\"<sup>[\\[1\\]][1]</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Smooth Number* is to define the term \"small\". If all prime factors of $n$ is smaller than $B$, we say $n$ has small factos, and such number $B$ called *$B$-smooth*.\n",

    "> Rigorously finding an ideal value of B involves complicated analytic number theory. Two important ideas are that it is better to choose it too large than too small, and also that the ideal value is about $\\exp{\\left (\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\log n \\log\\log n} \\right )}$.<sup>[\\[2\\]][2]</sup>\n",

    "higher powers and dividing hits by the underlying prime. Then the residual 1’s at the end\n",
